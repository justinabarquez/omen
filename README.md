Overview and goals
omen is designed to help developers add autonomous AI capabilities to Laravel-powered applications. It provides a framework for agents that can reason, plan, and act within a Laravel environment. The system is lightweight, extensible, and designed to integrate with Laravel’s existing patterns, including services, queues, events, and the container.

The project aims to:
- Provide a clear model for AI-driven workflows inside Laravel.
- Offer a safe and extensible plugin system for tools and APIs.
- Integrate with Laravel's task queues, events, and storage abstractions.
- Keep the developer experience familiar and approachable.

Key concepts
- Agent: The central unit that makes decisions and performs actions. The agent maintains a belief state, plans, and executes tasks.
- Plan: A sequence of steps the agent decides to perform to achieve a goal.
- Tool: External capability the agent can use, such as an HTTP API, a database operation, or a system command.
- Memory: A storage mechanism for the agent to recall prior decisions, outcomes, and context.
- Environment: The Laravel application and its services. The agent runs within this environment and uses its resources safely.

Why use omen with Laravel
- Laravel-aware design: The framework uses Laravel's service container, events, queues, and configuration patterns.
- PHP-first approach: Written for PHP and Laravel, it fits naturally into existing PHP projects.
- Extensible tools: Add new capabilities through a simple plugin system.
- Observability: Built-in logging, tracing, and metrics hooks to help you understand what the agent does.
- Safety and control: Clear boundaries for what an agent can do, with configurable safeguards.

System architecture
- Core engine: The decision maker that plans and orchestrates tasks.
- Planner: Converts goals into executable steps, with fallbacks.
- Executor: Runs the steps, calling tools and handling results.
- Tools/Plugins: Interfaces to external systems, APIs, and services.
- Memory store: Persists context and outcomes for future use.
- API layer: A clean interface for Laravel controllers, console commands, and services.

Installation and setup
Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1 or newer
- Composer
- A Laravel project (any recent Laravel version is supported)
- Optional: A database for memory and logs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Optional: A queue system (Redis, Beanstalkd, SQS) for asynchronous tasks

Install the package
- Use Composer to add omen to your project:
  - composer require justinabarquez/omen
- Publish configuration and resources:
  - php artisan vendor:publish --tag=omen-config
  - php artisan omen:install
- Set up environment variables:
  - OMEN_API_KEY for external tool access (if needed)
  - OMEN_MEMORY_DRIVER to choose a memory backend (sqlite, redis, database)
- Run migrations if you enable database memory:
  - php artisan migrate
- Start using omen in your code:
  - Create an agent, load tasks, and run the executor in a controller, command, or queue job

Notes about the installer and downloads
- For convenience and reproducibility, installer assets can be downloaded from the repository releases page. If you are using the Releases page, you typically download an installer file and run it to bootstrap the setup. The release assets are designed to kick off a standard onboarding flow that configures the agent environment for Laravel. The release assets can be found at the project’s Releases page.

Usage patterns and examples
- Quick start example
  - Create a simple agent that fetches data from a third-party API and stores results in your database.

Example PHP snippet (conceptual)
```php
use Omen\Agent;
use Omen\Tools\HttpClient;
use Omen\Memory\MemoryRepository;

$http = new HttpClient([
  'base_uri' => 'https://api.example.com',
  'timeout' => 5,
]);

$memory = new MemoryRepository();
$agent = new Agent([
  'memory' => $memory,
  'tools' => [
    $http,
  ],
]);

$goal = 'Fetch latest metrics and store in the database';
$plan = $agent->plan($goal);
$agent->execute($plan);
```

- Building a task for a Laravel controller
  - You can wire an agent to run as part of a Laravel controller action, a scheduled task, or a queued job. The agent can emit events that you can listen to, allowing you to react to decisions and outcomes in real time.

- Handling goals and prompts
  - A goal is a high-level objective. The planner breaks it into concrete tasks. Prompts guide the reasoning engine and influence tool use. You can customize prompts to align with your domain and policies.

- Tool integration patterns
  - REST API tools: Use HttpClient to talk to external services.
  - Database tools: Use Eloquent or the query builder for CRUD operations.
  - File system tools: Read and write to storage disks using Laravel's filesystem abstraction.
  - Messaging tools: Send messages through queues or real-time channels.

Architectural decisions
- Modularity: The core engine is independent from the environment. You can replace or extend components without touching core logic.
- Extensibility: Tool plugins can be added to support new services, APIs, or data formats.
- Observability: All decisions and actions can be traced. Logs and metrics help you understand the agent’s behavior.
- Safety: The framework includes safeguards to prevent unintended or harmful actions. You can configure what tools the agent may use and when.

Tooling and integrations
- HTTP and API tools
  - REST, GraphQL, and SOAP endpoints can be integrated via a common HttpClient tool.
- Data access
  - Use Eloquent models or the database query builder as part of a tool.
- Messaging
  - Queues and event broadcasts enable asynchronous task processing and real-time feedback.
- Authentication
  - Use Laravel’s authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive tools and data.
- Observability
  - Integrate with Laravel Telescope for introspection, or use custom dashboards to monitor agent activity.

Security and best practices
- Principle of least privilege
  - Give agents only the tools they need. Limit access to sensitive endpoints or data.
- Logging and auditing
  - Record decisions, tool invocations, and outcomes. Keep logs for compliance and debugging.
- Secrets management
  - Store API keys and credentials in Laravel’s env system, or use a secret manager. Avoid hard-coding secrets.
- Input validation
  - Validate prompts and tool outputs. Check for unexpected results before acting.
- Safe defaults
  - Disable dangerous tools by default and enable them only when explicitly approved.
- Observability
  - Regularly review agent activity. Look for patterns that indicate issues or misuse.

Testing, quality, and CI
- Unit tests
  - Test the planner, executor, and tool adapters in isolation.
- Integration tests
  - Verify that an agent can perform a end-to-end task in a staging environment.
- Property-based tests
  - Exercise the planner with a range of goals to ensure robust behavior.
- Static analysis
  - Use PHPStan or Psalm to catch type issues early.
- CI/CD
  - Run tests on push and pull requests. Validate code style with PHP-CS-Fixer.
- Versioning and releases
  - Use semantic versioning. Document changes in a changelog.

Development workflow
- Local development
  - Start a Laravel project, install omen, and run sample agents in a sandbox environment.
- Debugging
  - Use verbose logging and custom events to understand decisions and outcomes.
- Extending omen
  - Create new tools as Laravel services or standalone classes. Register them in the broker so agents can discover them.

Command-line interface
- omen has a small CLI to run agents, plan tasks, and manage memory.
- Typical commands:
  - php artisan omen:plan "Goal text"
  - php artisan omen:execute --plan-id=XYZ
  - php artisan omen:memory:prune
- The CLI is useful for experimentation and debugging.

Environment and hosting considerations
- Local development
  - Use a lightweight database like SQLite for memory during experiments.
- Staging
  - Use Redis for queues and a relational database for memory to mirror production.
- Production
  - Run agents in a queue worker or a dedicated process manager. Use a monitoring solution to track health and performance.
- Scaling
  - Scale by increasing concurrency for planning and execution. Use separate workers for planning, memory, and execution if needed.

Performance and optimization
- Caching
  - Cache expensive tool results to speed up planning in subsequent runs.
- Batching
  - Process tasks in batches to improve throughput without sacrificing safety.
- Asynchronous execution
  - Offload long-running tasks to queues. Keep the main flow responsive.
- Profiling
  - Profile agent decisions to identify bottlenecks and optimize prompts and planning strategies.
